## Hi there, this is Zenia 👋
😄 Pronouns: She/Her

📚 I hold an undergraduate degree in Economics, majoring in Accounting from University of Indonesia, and currently pursuing my master's in International Finance and Economic Policy from Columbia University

👩‍💻 This is my first time learning Python language!
